# Model Prediction for Machine Failure ‚öôÔ∏èüíª

## Project Background

Machine failures are a common challenge in the manufacturing industry, leading to unexpected downtime and increased costs. Understanding and predicting machine failures is critical for improving operational efficiency and reducing expenses. With advancements in predictive maintenance, leveraging data-driven models can significantly aid in early detection and prevention of such failures.

This project focuses on developing a machine failure prediction model to assist companies in minimizing unplanned maintenance costs and optimizing their production processes. By analyzing key machine parameters, the model aims to identify potential failures before they occur, enabling better planning and resource allocation.
